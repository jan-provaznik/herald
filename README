Simple remote heralding. A small step for the humankind, a giant leap towards a
completely over-engineered solution.

Example

  Consider a remote machine. It exposes some service. Consider another
  machine. One of its services depends on the remote service. It must wait for
  the remote service to be available.

  Suppose the remote service is a NFS server. We utilize herald-nfs.service on
  the remote machine. Once nfs-server.service finishes herald-nfs.service
  activates, exposing a simple HTTP server which can be queried.

  The other machine utilizes herald-wait@.service with its instance unit
  overridden to define the remote path.
